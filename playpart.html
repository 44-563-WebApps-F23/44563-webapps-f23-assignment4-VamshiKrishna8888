    <h1>Welcome to the Play</h1>
    <h6>An Enemy of the People By Henrik Ibsen</h6>
    <p>This is the website for information about the play featuring Henrik Ibsen.</p>
    <p><strong>Hovstad:</strong> No, not at all; I thought it would be better to wait until the
        spring, because it is just at this time that people begin to think
        seriously about their summer quarters.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Peter Stockmann:</strong> Quite right; you were perfectly right, Mr. Hovstad.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Hovstad:</strong> Yes, Thomas is really indefatigable when it is a question of
        the Baths.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Peter Stockmann:</strong> Well remember, he is the Medical Officer to the Baths.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Hovstad:</strong> Yes, and what is more, they owe their existence to him.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Peter Stockmann:</strong> To him? Indeed! It is true I have heard from time to
        time that some people are of that opinion. At the same time I must say
        I imagined that I took a modest part in the enterprise.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Mrs. Stockmann:</strong> Yes, that is what Thomas is always saying.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Hovstad:</strong> But who denies it, Mr. Stockmann? You set the thing going and
        made a practical concern of it; we all know that. I only meant that the
        idea of it came first from the doctor.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Peter Stockmann:</strong> Oh, ideas yes! My brother has had plenty of them in
        his time—unfortunately. But when it is a question of putting an idea
        into practical shape, you have to apply to a man of different mettle,
        Mr. Hovstad. And I certainly should have thought that in this house at
        least...</p>
        
        <p><strong>Mrs. Stockmann:</strong> My dear Peter—</p>
        
        <p><strong>Hovstad:</strong> How can you think that—?</p>
        
        <p><strong>Mrs. Stockmann:</strong> Won't you go in and have something, Mr. Hovstad? My
        husband is sure to be back directly.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Hovstad:</strong> Thank you, perhaps just a morsel. (Goes into the dining-room.)</p>
        
        <p><strong>Peter Stockmann (lowering his voice a little):</strong> It is a curious thing
        that these farmers' sons never seem to lose their want of tact.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Mrs. Stockmann:</strong> Surely it is not worth bothering about! Cannot you and
        Thomas share the credit as brothers?</p>
        
        <p><strong>Peter Stockmann:</strong> I should have thought so; but apparently some people
        are not satisfied with a share.</p>
