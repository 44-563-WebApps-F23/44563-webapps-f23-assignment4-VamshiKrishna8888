        <p class="speech">Quite right; you were perfectly right, Mr. Hovstad.</p>
        <h5 class="Hovstad">Hovstad</h5>
        <p class="direction">[coming forward into the sitting-room.]</p>
        <p class="speech">Yes, Thomas is really indefatigable when it is a question of
            the Baths.</p>
        <p class="direction">[la little embarrassed.]</p>
        <p class="speech">What is it?</p>
        <h5 class="peter">Peter Stockmann.</h5>
        <p class="speech">Well remember, he is the Medical Officer to the Baths.</p>
        <h5 class="Hovstad">Hovstad.</h5>

        <h5 class="peter">Peter Stockmann.</h5>
        <p class="speech">Oh, ideas yes! My brother has had plenty of them in
            his time—unfortunately. But when it is a question of putting an idea
            into practical shape, you have to apply to a man of different mettle,
